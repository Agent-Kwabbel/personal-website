			Hey there! First of all, thank you for visiting my website. I'm Fabe, a {age}-year-old from
			Utrecht, The Netherlands.

			<br /><br />

			I'm currently a graduate from
			<a
				href="https://www.heemlanden.nl/ons-onderwijs/wie-wij-zijn/onze-atheneum-plus"
				target="_blank">[ College de Heemlanden ]</a
			>. I'm a self-taught developer, and I'm passionate about creating websites and applications,
			such as games and computer programs. I have a deep interest in technology and STEM in general.
			That's why I've chosen the profile
			<a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_Netherlands#Curriculum"
				target="_blank">[ Nature & Technology ]</a
			>, with subjects including Informatics, Mathematics D, and NLT. This year I've finished my
			thesis for
			<a href="https://u-talent.nl/leerlingen/meerjarige-programmas/academy/" target="_blank"
				>[ U-Talent Academy]
			</a>
			about the use of epistemic logic.

			<br /><br />

			My journey with technology started at a young age. I've always been curious about how things
			work, and I've always been eager to learn new things. I started programming when I was 9 years
			old with Scratch and later progressed to HTML and CSS. I've been learning new things ever
			since, and I'm always looking for new challenges. Besides programming, I'm also interested in
			engineering. I was a member of
			<a href="https://www.djoamersfoort.nl/" target="_blank">[ DJO Amersfoort ]</a>
			where I learned a lot about electronics and robotics. Now, I'm pursuing a career in engineering
			or computer science.

			<br /><br />

			I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. If you have any questions or if
			you want to get in touch, feel free to send me an email at
			<a href="mailto:fabestuffken@proton.me">[ fabestuffken@proton.me ]</a>.

			<br /><br />

			<b>Skills:</b> Programming in HTML, CSS, JS/TS, Python, Java, C and C#. Experience with web
			frameworks, Git, Linux, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Unity. Knowledge of algorithms, data
			structures, and computer architecture.

			<br />

			<b>Hobbies and Interests:</b> Technology, gaming, music, kickboxing and more!

			<br /><br />

			I hope you've enjoyed your stay on my website! Cheers, Fabe
